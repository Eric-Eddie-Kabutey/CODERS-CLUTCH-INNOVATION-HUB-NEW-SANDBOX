                Once a viable opportunity is validated, internal teams are
                assembled to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), followed by
                structured acceleration phases that guide ventures through
                growth, product-market fit, revenue traction, and investment
                readiness.

                The Accelerator Factory Cohort 2021, led by BlueSPACE Innovation
                Hub, was a program designed to identify and scale high-potential
                digital ventures. It used data analysis, partner collaboration,
                and ecosystem feedback to develop MVPs and guide startups
                through growth, product-market fit, revenue traction, and
                investment readiness.

                The program was part of the Ghana Innovation Hub, established in
                2018 by a consortium of MDF West Africa, BlueSPACE Africa, and
                Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU). It operated
                under the World Bank-funded eTransform Ghana project,
                implemented by the Ministry of Communications and
                Digitalization.
